# Mobile-only route → screen mapping.
#
# This lets the mobile launcher remain 100% dynamic:
# - entity list routes are discovered from entities.*.meta.routes.list
# - non-entity “dashboard” routes can still be handled via this table
#
# Unknown keys are preserved in hit-ui-specs.json (forward compatible).
